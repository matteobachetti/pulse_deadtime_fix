    pip install pulse_deadtime_fix

Or, to install the development version

.. code-block::

    pip install git+https://github.com/matteobachetti/pulse_deadtime_fix.git

Usage
-----

Here is a simple example of how to correct the dead time distortion of a pulse profile.
The data in the example are from the Crab pulsar, observed with NuSTAR (ObsID 10302001004).

Note: **This technique will not work if the FITS event list does not have a PRIOR column indicating the livetime since the last event**.

The following ephemeris from the Jodrell Bank Observatory is used to fold the data:

.. code-block::

    PSRJ            J0534+2200
    RAJ             05:34:31.973
    DECJ            +22:00:52.06
    PEPOCH           58011.000000379725
    F0               29.6384226073
    F1               -3.6865813e-10
    F2               9.171123484933526e-21
    TZRMJD           58012.000000349
    TZRSITE          0
    TZRFRQ          0
    EPHEM           DE200
    UNITS           TDB
    CLK             TT(TAI)


At this point, it is sufficient to calculate the folded profile as follows:

.. code-block::python

    from pulse_deadtime_fix.core import fold_and_correct_profile
    from stingray import EventList

    ev = EventList.read("nu10302001004A01_bary.evt", additional_columns=["prior"], fmt="hea")
    phas, prof_raw, prof_corr = fold_and_correct_profile(
        ev.time,
        ev.prior,
        (58011.000000379725 - ev.mjdref) * 86400,
        [29.6384226073, -3.6865813e-10, 9.171123484933526e-21]
    )

And the comparison between the raw and the corrected profile (in arbitrary units) is:

Contributing
------------

We love contributions! pulse_deadtime_fix is open source,
built on open source, and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

`Adrienne Lowe <https://github.com/adriennefriend>`_ for a
`PyCon talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo>`_, and was adapted by
pulse_deadtime_fix based on its use in the README file for the
`MetPy project <https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy>`_.
